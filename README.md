## Description
An expense tracker built to record weekly and daily income and expense transactions.
This web app was build using ASP.NET with Entity Framework.

### Features
- SQL Server Database for storing and retreiving expenses made
- A dashboard combined with graphs to analyse weekly expense and income streams using SyncFusion components.

### Thing I learnt
- How to incorporate Razor pages which use CsHTML.
- A dislike for combining front-end and back-end into one project hierarchy. ( I prefer seperating FE & BE. Using React would have been a better idea imo ) 
- Improved my knowledge of using Entity Framework and migrations with SQL Server.
